                <p class="message">I started my business over 20 years ago, and when I began working with Charles, I was seeking guidance to help me reach goals that had remained out of reach. Working with Charles has been a game-changer. I have found him to be an invaluable partner and guide, particularly in areas like leadership training, human resources, and compensation structures.  Charles has consistently demonstrated a high level of professionalism—he is punctual, thoughtful, and a great listener. His ability to approach complex issues with both a calm demeanor and a logical framework has been crucial in helping me tackle challenges and achieve significant progress. His mentorship and support have accelerated my ability to make impactful changes, often faster than I would have otherwise.</p>
                <p class="message-separator">. . .</p>
                <p class="message">As an entrepreneur, it can be lonely at times, and having an independent sounding board like Charles has been incredibly helpful. His balanced approach, especially when guiding me to make more objective and logic-based decisions, has had a lasting positive effect on my leadership style and the way I run my business. He has taught me how to construct tools and processes that not only streamline decision-making but also reduce the emotional weight that can come with entrepreneurial challenges.</p>
                <p class="message-separator">. . .</p>
                <p class="message">In short, Charles has been an exceptional mentor and collaborator, and I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a strategic partner who brings thoughtful guidance and actionable insights. His expertise and approach have made a profound difference in my business, and I am confident he would bring the same value to any team.</p>

                <p class="message">I've had the opportunity to work closely with Charles on a project of strategic importance at the University of Michigan and have been impressed by his ability to think strategically, work effectively across a wide variety of stakeholders, and make progress at moving decision making along.  Charles is smart, strategic and an effective communicator, and someone who has been an asset to my team and to the University with his work.</p>

                <p class="message">Charles has the unique ability to see complex problems from high level down to the finest of details. Not only does he identify the difference with this ability to zoom in and out – from the broad scope to minute details – but he also has the intellectual toolkit to actually address the problems with practical solutions. Perhaps the strongest thing I can say, though, is that through his work, he is an absolute pleasure to spend time with.</p>
